> - Whispering's evolution beyond transcription required changes to the repository's structure and branding.
> - Everything else remains the same‚Äîsame tools, same philosophy, same team.
> - The original app lives on as [*Epicenter Whispering*](https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/tree/main/apps/whispering), keeping a tight focus on transcription.
> - This makes room for standalone apps with complementary, but non-transcription-related features (like [*Epicenter Assistant*](https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/tree/main/apps/sh)).
> - The new [root](https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/) of the Epicenter repository contains common files supporting all the apps in the ecosystem.
> - Note: the old URL [github.com/braden-w/whispering](https://github.com/braden-w/whispering) is now just a thin placeholder redirecting to this rebranded repository.

## What is Epicenter?

Epicenter is an ecosystem of open-source, local-first apps. Our eventual goal is to store all of your data‚Äînotes, transcripts, chat histories‚Äîin a single folder of plain text and SQLite. Every tool we build shares this memory. It's open, tweakable, and yours. Grep it, open it in Obsidian, host it wherever you like. The choice is yours.

### The Vision (how the ecosystem will work):

- Long-time Epicenter Whispering users may have configured numerous LLM API keys, transformations, and even local models.
- When the Epicenter Assistant is started for the very first time, all these API keys, transformations and local models seamlessly work.
- Epicenter Assistant may even access Whispering transcription history to provide personalized results out of the box.
- Of course, this works the other way, too: Whispering can take advantage of your Epicenter Assistant history to optimize transcriptions and transformations!
- In a siloed ecosystem, this requires much more effort, or may not even be possible.

## Where We're Headed

Our vision is to build a personal workspace where you own your data, choose your models, and replace siloed apps with open, interoperable alternatives. All while preserving authenticity and being free and open source.


## Quick Start

Epicenter will have more apps in the future, but for now, the best way to get started is to run Whispering locally:

```bash
# Prerequisites: 
# - Install Bun from https://bun.sh (run bun upgrade if there's issues)
# - Install Rust and Cargo from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install (brew install rustup)


git clone https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter.git
cd epicenter
bun install  # Will prompt to upgrade if your Bun version is too old
cd apps/whispering
bun dev
```

### Alternative: Using Nix (Deterministic Development Environment)

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/download) installed, you can get a complete, reproducible development environment with all dependencies pre-configured:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter.git
cd epicenter
nix run .#dev  # Builds and runs Whispering desktop app
# OR
nix run .#web-dev  # Runs web version only
# OR  
nix develop  # Enters development shell with all tools available
```

The Nix flake provides:
- Complete Rust toolchain with all necessary targets
- Bun, Node.js, and all build tools
- All GTK/WebKit system dependencies for Tauri
- Audio libraries for transcription features
- Deterministic, reproducible builds across machines
